Projects I have used for design inspiration are as follows:

1. [Wordle - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

Blogs I have read in problem shooting are as follows:

1. [What is the way to inherit std::string right?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20512547/what-is-the-way-to-inherit-stdstring-right)
2. [Uses and Abuses of Inheritance, Part 1](http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill06.htm)

I have asked these students for help on certain topics:

1. 戴英杰，熊泽恩：I had a short discussion with each of them about whether it's best practice to inherit from STL templates, when attempting to extend member functions of std::string, no code exchanged. 23/07/02
